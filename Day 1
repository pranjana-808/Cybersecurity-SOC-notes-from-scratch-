# Daily SOC Notes

**Purpose:**  
Daily hands-on notes for learning SOC (Security Operations Center) and Linux basics for cybersecurity.

## Day 1 – Key Learnings

### SOC Basics
- SOC = 24/7 security monitoring center  
- SOC Analyst: monitor alerts, analyze logs, investigate incidents  
- Tools: SIEM (Splunk, Wazuh), firewalls, IDS  

### Linux Basics
- `pwd` → show current directory  
- `ls` → list files  
- `cd` → change directory  
- `mkdir`, `touch` → create folders/files  
- `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail` → read files  
- `chmod`, `ls -l` → file permissions  

### File Searching
- `find . -name "*.log"` → find files by extension  

### Grep / Log Analysis
- `grep "text" file` → search text in file  
- `grep -E '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' auth.log` → find IPs  
- `grep "Failed password" auth.log` → find failed logins  
- Combine: `grep "Failed password" auth.log | grep -oE '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}'`  

**SOC Analyst Mindset:**  
- Who did what?  
- Where from?  
- When?  
- Next action?

**Next Step:**  
- Practice log analysis with simulated logs  
- Extract IPs and detect threats  
- Continue daily SOC exercises
