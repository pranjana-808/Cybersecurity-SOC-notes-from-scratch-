🛡️ SOC Day 2 – Practical Logs & Investigation


1️⃣ Objective
Learn to analyze authentication logs.
Detect brute-force attacks, successful compromise, and privilege escalation.
Practice hands-on SOC investigation in Termux.

2️⃣ Preparation
Created practice folder in Termux: mkdir soc-day2 && cd soc-day2
Created sample auth.log with realistic failed and successful SSH attempts.
Sample logs used:

Copy code
Failed password for invalid user admin from 45.83.64.10 ssh2
Failed password for invalid user root from 45.83.64.10 ssh2
Failed password for pranjal from 92.18.201.44 ssh2
Accepted password for pranjal from 92.18.201.44 ssh2
sudo: pranjal : COMMAND=/bin/bash

3️⃣ Commands Used (SOC Practical)
View logs: cat auth.log / less auth.log

Search failed logins: grep "Failed password" auth.log

Search successful logins: grep "Accepted password" auth.log

Extract IPs: grep -oE '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' auth.log
Count attacks per IP:

Copy code
grep "Failed password" auth.log | grep -oE '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

4️⃣ Observations / Analysis
observe the pattern like : number of attempts, ip, port number, and monitor the security level 24/7

5️⃣ SOC Mindset Learned
Look for who, what, when, how many in logs.
Differentiate between attack method vs protocol info.

Classify incidents by severity:
Successful login + sudo = Critical
Repeated failures = Medium/High, depending on context

SOC report style language:
“Multiple failed login attempts indicate SSH brute-force. The presence of multiple external IPs suggests distributed sources. Successful login followed by sudo escalation indicates system compromise (Critical).”

6️⃣ Key Takeaways
SOC analysis is detective work — logs tell the story.
ssh2 ≠ attack; failed logins = brute-force attempts.
Multiple IPs ≠ spoofing; usually bot/proxy.
Critical incidents = shell access with sudo/root privileges.

Commands like grep, sort, uniq, and regex are essential SOC tools.
